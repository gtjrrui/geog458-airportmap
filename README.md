# GEOG 458: Map of Airports per State in USA

![Example of Map](./img/airport_map.png)

### Introduction

This project involved mapping out all the airports in the United States, and categorizing and calculating the number of airports for every state. Each airport in their respective state is designated by color, while the color concentration of each state represents the amount of airports per state. It is possible to find out the name of each airport by clicking on the icon, which will bring up the name of the place with a pop-up window.
